@dev Returns true if `account` is a contract.\n [IMPORTANT]\n ====\n It is unsafe to assume that an address for which this function returns\n false is an externally-owned account (EOA) and not a contract.\n Among others, `isContract` will return false for the following\n types of addresses:\n  - an externally-owned account\n  - a contract in construction\n  - an address where a contract will be created\n  - an address where a contract lived, but was destroyed\n ====\n [IMPORTANT]\n ====\n You shouldn't rely on `isContract` to protect against flash loan attacks!\n Preventing calls from contracts is highly discouraged. It breaks composability, breaks support for smart wallets\n like Gnosis Safe, and does not provide security since it can be circumvented by calling from a contract\n constructor.\n
